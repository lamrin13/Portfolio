> "Success is a ladder, not an escalator"

I strongly believe in this quote, and therefore, it makes me a process-oriented individual.
 I feel that if we focus on the process, the results follow automatically. I am a Full Stack Software Engineer
  with a three-year achievement record in agile environments. I have verifiable proficiency in designing, 
  developing, and deploying innovative, high-performance software products, solutions, and APIs. I am committed to 
  excellence and adept at writing clear, reliable, testable, and maintainable code. I am an exceptionally dedicated
   professional with impressive communication, interpersonal, and relationship-building skills that thrive in dynamic 
   cross-functional environments.
